      <h4>Naus FPV</h4>
      <h1>What is FPV?</h1>
      <p><b>First-person view (FPV)</b>, is a method used to control a radio-controlled vehicle from the driver or pilot's view point. Most commonly it is used to pilot a radio-controlled aircraft or in my case, FPV drone racing!  This is a sport where participants control "drones" (typically small radio-controlled aircraft or quadcopters), equipped with cameras while wearing head-mounted displays showing the live stream camera feed from the drones.</p>

          <h1>How I got started.</h1>
          <p>Just like anyone else that is board and browsing YouTube, I stumbled accross a FPV Racing viedo. From that point on I was hooked. Watching every video I could find. Just thinking, "WOW these pilot get to fly these multi rotors as if they where actully in them at speed of 60mph. So I set out to do my research and picked all the parts needed to get started. Once the boxes came in the mail I jumpped right to it and built my first multi rotor, a QAV250. At this point I had no idea what PIDs are or how to correctly set them up. I Just copied some from an amazing pilot on YouTube and took it out flying. This is where the Learning curve started, and digging into my pokets to replace part after part! This did not stop me and after months of learning and and reaserch I was able to finally fly without crashing every time. So my goal now is to pass on my mistakes and help anyone interested in FPV and grow this hobby.</p>
